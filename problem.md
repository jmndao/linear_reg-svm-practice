### $$ Advanced Machine Learning $$

#### Practical I

The objective of this practical is to catch up with the overview of the covered material of Machine
Learning. It is important to understand the difference of Logistic regression versus the Support
Vector Machine.

##### Exercise 1: Theory

(a) Describe the Logistic regression
(b) Describe the Support vector Machine. 
(c) Explain the word regularisation and justify its importance. 

##### Exercise 1: Data preprocessing (2)

(a) Go to any open source data repository (Example:  
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php ) and download a data set of the following
specifications.
i. The number of instances/records is at least 1000.
ii. The number of features/attributes/ is a least 20.
iii. It has labels/classes/categories (classification data).
(b) Pre-process the data. (2 per each sub-question)
i. Clean the data and remove all missing values.
ii. Choose at least 15 features to define your vector of independent variables (say X) and
the dependent variable which just contains numerical classes.
iii. Split the data intro training and testing sets.
iv. Perform the standard scale of the data if necessary.

##### Exercise 2 Learning modelling

1. Use the Logistic Regression model to describe a related classification model.
2. Use the Support Vector Machine model to describe a related classification model. 
3. Make comparison of these two learning model and investigate on the reason of your finding.
